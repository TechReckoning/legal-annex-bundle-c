# Sample PDFs

This directory would normally contain sample PDF files for testing the Caselib Bundle application. Since we cannot include actual PDF files in this demo, users can test by uploading their own PDF files.

## Testing the Application

1. Upload PDF files using the drag & drop area or "Adaugă PDF-uri" button
2. Rename annexes by double-clicking on their titles
3. Reorder annexes using the up/down arrows or drag & drop
4. Configure formatting in the "Formatare" tab
5. Preview the cover pages and table of contents in the "Previzualizare" tab
6. Export the final bundle using "Exportă PDF"

The exported PDF will contain:
1. Table of contents (Opis) listing all annexes
2. For each annex: A generated cover page followed by the original PDF content
