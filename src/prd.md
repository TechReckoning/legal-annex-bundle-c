**Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays for content hierarchy
**Accent Color**: Warm gold (oklch(0.65 0.15 45)) - highlights important actions

- Primary button text (white) on primary (oklch(0.45 0.12 240)) - 9.4:1 ratio
- Muted text (oklch(0.45 0.04 240)) on background - 6.8:1 ratio

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single family (Inter) with weight and size variations for hierarchy

**Font Personality**: Inter conveys modern professionalism without sacrificing readability
**Readability Focus**: 1.5 line height, generous spacing, optimal line length for legal text scanning
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent scale (12, 14, 16, 20, 24px) across all elements
**Which fonts**: Inter from Google Fonts - excellent for professional applications
**Legibility Check**: Inter tested extensively for screen reading and document clarity

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
